## Greetings 👋

I am a mycologist whose research explores the diversity of macrofungi. 🍄🍄🍄
My research uses DNA sequence data to study fungal diversity. This requires editing and analysis of sequence data from fungi.

Here are some of the projects I am involved in.
- The application of high-throughput sequencing to study specimens from fungaria.
- Metabarcoding analysis to identify plant-associated fungi.
- Analysis of fungal sequence data from soil and litter environments.

Where my research is developing...
- I am looking to develop my proficiency in both Python and R.
- I am collaborating on a research proposal to study the diversity of the Thelephorales.
- I am collaborating to incorporate macrofungi in North American natural heritage conservation plans.
